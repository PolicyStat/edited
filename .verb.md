## How does it work?

It listens on the events that could possibly be edits on the
provided element and determines their edit type.

Edit types are:
* Character addition
* Backward deletion
* Forward deletion
* Space
* Enter
* Paste
* Drop

When the last edit type is different than the previous, then it is
determined that a sensible edit was made and the provided callback is
fired.

Also, for edit types paste and drop, each consecutive edit is determined
a significant edit.

Makes sense?

This may be useful for registering undo/redo points, resource–friendlier
autosaves and probably more (register an issue describing your
integration and I’ll mention it here).

## Usage
``` javascript
var Edited = require(‘edited’)

var onSensible = function () {
  // register undo point, autosave, etc
}

// optional: provide a function that will be called on any edit
var onAny = function () {
  // this may also be useful
}

var edited = new Edited(someEditableElement, onSensible, onAny)

// benefit!

// in case you don’t require it any more
edited.detach() // and it will stop listening
```

The callbacks are called synchronously, before the native event (the edit)
occurs.

The callbacks are called with the instance as `this`.

The provided editable element can be accessed as the `element` property of
the instance.
